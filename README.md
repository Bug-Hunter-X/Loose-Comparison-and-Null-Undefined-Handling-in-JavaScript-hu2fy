# Loose Comparison and Null/Undefined Handling in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving loose comparison (==) and how it can lead to unexpected behavior when handling null and undefined values.

The `bug.js` file shows a function that attempts to handle both null and undefined values using loose comparison. However, this approach can have unintended consequences because loose comparison treats many falsy values (such as 0, false, and empty string) as equal to null and undefined.  This leads to unexpected behavior that may cause the function to produce incorrect output in the presence of certain falsy values.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a more robust solution using strict equality (===) to explicitly check for null and undefined values, thus preventing unintended behavior.
